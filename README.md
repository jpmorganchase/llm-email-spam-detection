# Spam-T5: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Few-Shot Email Spam Detection

*by Maxime Labonne and Sean Moran*

This paper has been submitted for publication in [ECML PKDD 2023](https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/) and is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01238.pdf).

It evaluates different baseline techniques and large language models for email spam detection. It also introduces **Spam-T5**, a modified [Flan-T5](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base) model which significantly outperforms other models.

## Abstract

This paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in email spam detection by comparing prominent models from three distinct families: BERT-like, Sentence Transformers, and Seq2Seq. Additionally, we examine well-established machine learning techniques for spam detection, such as Na√Øve Bayes and LightGBM, as baseline methods. We assess the performance of these models across four public datasets, utilizing different numbers of training samples (full training set and few-shot settings). Our findings reveal that, in the majority of cases, LLMs surpass the performance of the popular baseline techniques, particularly in few-shot scenarios. This adaptability renders LLMs uniquely suited to spam detection tasks, where labeled samples are limited in number and models require frequent updates. Additionally, we introduce Spam-T5, a Flan-T5 model that has been specifically adapted and fine-tuned for the purpose of detecting email spam. Our results demonstrate that Spam-T5 surpasses baseline models and other LLMs in the majority of scenarios, particularly when there are a limited number of training samples available.
